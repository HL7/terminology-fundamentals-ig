  <h3>Concepts and Codes</h3>
  <p>
    A Concept is defined as an unitary mental representation of a real or abstract thing – an atomic unit of thought. It should be unique in a given Code System. 
	A concept may have synonyms in terms of representation and it may be a singleton, or may be constructed of other concepts (i.e. post-coordinated concepts).
  </p>
  <p>
    Concepts, as abstract, language- and context-independent representations of meaning, are important for the design and interpretation of HL7 data models. 
	They constitute the smallest semantic entities on which HL7 datamodels are built. The authors and the readers of a model use concepts and their relationships 
	to build and understand the models; these are what matter to the human user of HL7 data models. The rest of the vocabulary machinery exists to permit software 
	manipulation of these units of thought.
  </p>
  <p>
    A Concept Representation is defined as a vocabulary object that enables the manipulation of a Concept in HL7. A Concept Representation exists in some form 
	that is computable, and can be used in HL7 models and specifications. Concept Representations can take on a number of different roles in the structure and 
	processing of vocabulary in HL7; these roles and functions are described below.
  </p>
  <p>
   A Code is defined as a  Concept Representation published by the author of a Code System as part of the Code System. It is the preferred unique identifier for 
   that concept in that Code System for the purpose of communication (preferred wire-format identifier), and is used in the 'code' property of an HL7 coded data type. 
   Codes are sometimes meaningless identifiers, and sometimes they are mnemonics that imply the represented concept to a human reader. In Code Systems that contain more 
   than one Concept Identifier, the one that should be used in HL7 as the Code should be explicitly declared.
  </p>
  <p>
    The meaning of a Code within a particular Code System entity is valid only within that Code System. For example, each table having enumerated codes in the HL7 Codes
	are sometimes used in different Code Systems to have different meanings. One example is the code "M" in the <a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0001">Administrative Sex</a> Code System which signifies "Male," 
	whereas the code "M" in the in the <a href="http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v2-0001">Marital Status</a> Code System signifies "Married". Another example is the code "1609-7" which signifies the Native American tribe 
	"Sioux" in the Race &amp; Ethnicity – CDC Code System, and the code "1609-7" which signifies "Prolactin^1.5H post dose insulin IV" in the LOINC Code System. Codes do 
	not have explicit semantics without their Code Systems, and cannot be referenced without identifying the code system in which they are published.
  </p>
  <p>
    A Concept Identifier is defined as a  Concept Representation that may be published by the Code System author, and unambiguously represents the concept internally 
	within the context of that Code System. Such an object used for identification, when combined with the unique identifier of the Code System itself (a machine-processable 
	unique string), provides a globally unique and language-independent identification for the particular concept. This globally unique identification can be used in transactions 
	and data records that span both space and time. In some cases, multiple synonymous identifiers may be present for the same concept.

    A Designation is defined as a  Concept Representation that may be published by the Code System author. These are additional representations for the concept. Use cases include 
	other languages or aliases used for particular purposes for a concept that are intended to convey meaning to a human being. A Designation is typically used to populate an alternate display for the concept.
