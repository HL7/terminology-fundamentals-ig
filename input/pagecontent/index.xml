  <h3>HL7 Terminology</h3>
  <p>
    Terminology (often referred to as Vocabulary) describes the structured data for clinical and administrative information that can be recorded and exchanged in HL7 specifications.
  </p>
  <p>
    In HL7, the possible values for data elements and the associated meanings of those values are defined in Code Systems, from which both the Concept Representation and any 
	associated meanings are drawn. The set of codes that are allowed for a particular coded model element is referred to as a Value Set.
  </p>
  <p>
    The tabs in this IG describe the structural properties of Concepts, Code Systems, and Value Sets, while the section after that (Vocabulary Conformance) 
	describes the usage of these concepts in the business context of HL7 information models and data types. (NEED TO UPDATE)

  <h3>The Rationale - Semantic interoperability</h3>
  <p>
    In HL7's view, interoperability requires that the systems be able to "exchange" information reliably and securely ("functional interoperability") and be
	able to correctly and consistently interpret the information being exchanged ("semantic interoperability").
  </p>
  <p>
    In the 21st Century, "functional interoperability" is increasingly easy to accomplish. what with the availability of carefully integrated computational 
	and communication environments in which to implement. "Semantic Interoperability," however, poses major challenges, particularly for the enterprise of health care in which:
  </p>
  <ul>
	<li><p>the intellectual space continues to expand so rapidly that most individuals cannot keep pace;</p></li>
	<li><p>the interpretation of any given data element is inexorably linked to the context in which that element was discovered, and the whole of the other data about the same subject;</p></li>
	<li><p>the data content requires precise, and frequently extensive scientific representation;</p></li>
	<li><p>a large, fraction of the data encoded in rich terminologies that are both vast, and continually expanding; and</p></li>
	<li><p>human life and well-being depend upon the rapid, correct interpretation of the information.</p></li>
  </ul>

    This implementation guide defines additional constraints and usage expectations above and beyond the information found in these base specifications.
