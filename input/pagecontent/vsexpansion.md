A Value Set Expansion Code Set is the complete enumeration of the member list of Concept Representations as defined in a Value Set Content Logical Definition 
(CLD) using the required code systems.

The original STU publication of this Standard included an informative Value Set Expansion section. This section has been 
removed in this Normative publication as this information is being developed as a separate normative-track standard â€“ Specifications for Value Set Expansion.25
