A Value Set Expansion Code Set is the complete enumeration of the member list of Concept Representations as defined in a Value Set Content Logical Definition 
(CLD) using the required code systems. Expansions are described in detail on the <a href="valuesets.html">Value Sets</a> page. More information about how the 
Value Set Definition and Value Set Expansion relate to each other is described <a href="valuesetdefinition.html#relationship-between-the-value-set-definition-and-value-set-expansion-code-set">here</a>.  

While there is no equivalent specification for Value Set Expansions as there is for the Definition, the Canonical Resource Management Infrastructure (CRMI) Implementation Guide 
describes the elements required to define a Value Set Expansion through the <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/uv/crmi/StructureDefinition-crmi-expandedvalueset.html">CRMI Expanded ValueSet</a> profile. 
While this specification is realized in FHIR, it can be generalized to conform to other product family implementations.
